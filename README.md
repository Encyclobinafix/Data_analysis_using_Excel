## **Introduction:**
___
This is an Excel project. I am currently undergoing a data analytics training and for my first week of training, I was given two assignments. The first assignment required that I create an employee data set and answer some specific questions, practicing the use of conditional foormatting. For the second assignment, a company's sales dataset was provided. Having been taught conditional formatting, data manipulation, managaement, functions, and formulas in Excel, it is exciting to use the skills learned to analyse the dataset and provide useful insights.
-*Disclaimaer:*_ The datasets used for this project are solely made up for the purpose of training.

  **Excel functions and formulars Applied:**
  - conditional formatting
  - text to column
  - sort and filter
  - find and select
  - data type formatting
  - functions e.g [LEFT(), RIGHT(), SUM(), AVERAGE(), CONCATNATE(), COUNT(), IF(), MIN(), MAX()]


## **Problem Statement/Questions to be answered:**
___
### _*Assignment 1:*_

*Step 1:*
I created an employee dataset containing 20 rows of unique employee id, full names, department, salary, and job type. Then, I formatted the data by aligning the texts, changing the data type, and highlighting the headers.

- For question 1, I copied the data to a new worksheet and labelled it. Next, using the filters function, I seleceted employees who are freelancers under the "job type" column. Next, I used conditional formatting to highlight in green, freelancers whose slaries were above $10,000.

- For question 2, I copied the data to a new worsheet and split the employees fullnames using two diffetent functions. First, I inserted 2 columns to the right of column B and using the "tesxt-to-column" function, I split the names into 2 different columns, specifying the delimeter. Secondly, I used the LEN and MID functions to split the fullnames into columns H and I just to showcase a range of how the same results can be accomplished. As an additional perk, I used the CONCATNATE function to join the first and last names back together into column J.

  



### _*Assignment 2:*_

*Step 1:*
The business had questions about their sales that they needed answers to. They wanted to know the following:

- What was the total revenue?
- How much profit was generated?
- What was the average revenue?
- On average, how many units of products were sold?
- How much discount was given in total?
- How many transactions were recorded?
- What was the highest profit generated in a single transaction?
- Display high and low sales values
